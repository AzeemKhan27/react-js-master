
vite : vite is the bundle and we used it to create our react project, because it is installing so quickly.

if we use React:-
- npx create react projectName

delete some files :-
 
 - setupTests.js
 - reportWebVitals.js
 - logo.svg
 - App.test.js

if we use React + vite

 delete some files :-  App.css, index.css
